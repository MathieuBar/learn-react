1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
apply a function to each element of the array and return an array of the transformed elements


2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
to loop over a data array and render as much components as elements in the array


3. Critical thinking: why is using `.map()` better than just
   creating the components manually by typing them out?
you can use data independantly from rendering
